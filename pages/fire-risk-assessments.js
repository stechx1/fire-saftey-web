                A fire risk assessment is crucial to your business’s health and
                safety efforts. It is also a legal requirement aimed at
                providing long-term safety of both your staff and premises from
                potential fire damage.

                  What is a Fire Risk Assessment

                <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
                  A fire risk assessment is a detailed step by step process
                  measuring the efficiency of current fire precautions and
                  procedural arrangements. The overall purpose of the fire risk
                  assessment is to identify the risk to life and consequences of
                  a fire.

                  The legislation states that “ The responsible person must make
                  fire risk assessment under The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety)
                  Order 2005, Article 9 (1) and must keep it up to date under
                  Article 9(3).

                <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
                  A fire risk assessment needs to be recorded when the 
                  Responsible Person employs five or more people (whether in one
                  location or spread over a number of locations or a licence

                <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
                  If you employ five or more people your fire risk assessment
                  must be recorded. If your business has a license in place you
                  must also keep a written record of your fire risk assessment.
                  Best practise is to keep a copy of the assessment in the
                  premises visible to all staff and enforcing authority

                  Any fire risk assessment must be reviewed by the Responsible

                  Prevention is always better than cure. Carrying out a fire
                  risk assessment you are likely to avoid prosecution and
                  financial penalty. Your business may continue to benefit from
                  low cost insurance premium.

                  In 2004 the cost as a consequence of fire in UK, including
                  property damage, human casualties and lost business, were
                  estimated at £2.5 billion. Additionally some business that
                  experience a fire never reopen. Some companies experiencing a
                  fire and do not re-open within a month are likely to go out of
                  business permanently.

                According to the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005,
                &apos;the responsible person&apos; has a legal duty to take all
                reasonable steps to make sure that fire safety levels are
                appropriate at all times. The segment of the legislation
                focusing on fire risk assessments begins as follows:

              The responsible person must make a suitable and sufficient
              assessment of the risks to which relevant persons are exposed for
              the purpose of identifying the general fire precautions he needs
              to take to comply with the requirements and prohibitions imposed
              on him by or under this Order.{' '}
            </p>
            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              This legislation applies to all non-domestic properties including
              commercial and public premises, such as shops, factories,
              warehouses and offices, but also schools, nursing homes as well as
              businesses providing sleeping accommodation. It also applies to
              sheltered housing as well as the communal areas of blocks of flats
              and houses in multiple occupation (HMOs); though not to the
              individual dwellings within the HMO.

            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              For businesses employing five or more employees, there is a legal
              requirement to not only carry out a fire risk assessment, but to
              document the findings in writing. Fire Risk Assessments can be
              carried out by the organisation or business affected. There are
              official fire risk assessment help guides available and FRA forms
              can be downloaded for free from a number of sources.{' '}
            </p>
            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              However, if you have doubts as to your ability to carry out an FRA
              it is highly recommended to engage the services of a professional
              fire risk assessor to ensure you comply with all relevant
              regulations.{' '}

            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              Areas that need to be considered in almost all fire risk
              assessments are fire detection systems, emergency exits and routes
              (including evacuation plans), firefighting equipment and the
              availability of information and advice to the building’s
              occupants.
            </p>
            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              Issues such as the specific needs of vulnerable people and the
              safe storage of any dangerous substances must also be considered.
              However, these may not always be a relevant factor for the fire
              risk assessment depending on the use of the building.
            </p>
            <p className={headingStyles.smallpara}>
              It is important to note that any changes in occupancy or
              activities within premises must be reflected in the fire risk
              assessment. This means the document should be reviewed regularly
              and updated if necessary.
